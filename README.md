# Working with Geochemical Data
Welcome! Here is a repository that I will periodically update with things that I find useful for working with, quantifying, manipulating, and visualizing geochemical data. 

This will usually be in the form of Jupyter notebooks, but occasionally more in depth scripts will be written and be called in as modules.

Please feel free to take these scripts and make them your own suggest things you want to see me code up

Happy number crunching!
