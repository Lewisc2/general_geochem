# Working with Geochemical Data
Welcome! Here is a repository that will be periodically updated with things that we find useful for working with, quantifying, manipulating, and visualizing geochemical data. 

This will usually be in the form of Jupyter notebooks, but occasionally more in depth scripts will be written and be called in as modules. One such module that many of the notebooks rely heavily on is the ever evolving module ```magmatrace```. This is also a work in progress but currently has equations pertaining to:

- general melting and crystallization equations (e.g., equilibrium, rayleigh, *in situ*, etc.)
- plagioclase Arrhenius partitioning equations (e.g., Bindeman et al., 1998; Nielsen et al.; 2017, Tepley et al., 2010)
- general mineral formula recalculation
- isotope mixing equations from DePaolo (1981) and Aitcheson and Forrest (1994)
- zircon saturation equations from Boehnke et al., (2013) and Watson and Harrison (1983)
- 

Please feel free to take these scripts and make them your own or suggest things you want to see us code up

Happy number crunching!
